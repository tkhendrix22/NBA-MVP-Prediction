# Overview 
This project analyzes existing data about various individuals - some who have been an NBA MVP(most valuable player), and many who have not. To be an MVP in the NBA is easily one of the most challenging individual accomplishments. Voting for MVP is never easy, though some years there are more clear winners than others. And yet, there are also times when a player might seem like an obvious choice for MVP but he still doesn’t win the award.  We use this data in order to develop a predictive model that can aid a stakeholder, The NBA MVP voting panel, in determining whether or not a player should be MVP based on stats. Although this data does not specifically discuss a players specific team success, advanced stats are being taken into effect to evaluate how the game is played today and what attributes coaches and teams deem to be valuable to win nowadays. After utilizing the process of exploratory data analysis, we create several classification models to eventually reach the model with the highest and most appropriate recall.

# Business Understanding
Until the 1979–80 season, the MVP was selected by a vote of NBA players. Since the 1980–81 season, the award is decided by a panel of sportswriters and broadcasters throughout the United States and Canada. Each member of the voting panel casts a vote for first to fifth place selections. Unless there is a unanimous MVP which has only happened once when Stephen Curry won the award in 2015-16, the voting process can be very scrutinized amongst the league among players, coaches, and team officials. The goal here is to create a model that can output the player who is most worthy of the award without any second guessing. 

# Data Analysis
The data that I used for this project comes from a dataset from FiveThirtyEight titled, 'The Best NBA Players, According To RAPTOR' and also a data set from Kaggle titled 'NBA MVP Predictor Dataset'. This source is comprised of advanced stats that go beyond the box score and takes into effect the pace of the game, spacing, and the offensive and defensive nuances of the game. This gives stats of all players dating back to 2013 and takes into account of players who have been MVP and who has not.
